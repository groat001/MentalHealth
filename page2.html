  More often,
  <span class="boldtext">
  younger generations
  </span>
  have
<span class="boldtext">
  more symptoms
  </span>
  <br> of anxiety and depression
  than generations before them. COVID didnâ€™t
  change this fact but increased the effect.

  Researched focused on college students,
  data <br> was collected once during 2019 and again in 2020.
</div>

<div class="text9">
  From the results, anxiety disorders
<span class="boldtext">
  decreased
  </span>
  from 25.5% <br>to 18.9%.
    Depression
<span class="boldtext">
    increased
  </span>
  by 8.7% to a total of 23.6%. Furthermore,
    results often show an increased number of anxiety and
    depression in females.
</div>

<div class="text10">
<span class="boldtext">
COVID
</span>
played a major cause in these changes. When students were asked
 to explain possible reasons or concerns for their disorders,
 recurring worries were <br>
<span class="boldtext2">
 social isolation and worries of infection
from COVID.</span>
</div>

<div class="text11">
These statics relate to the idea that it is possible for anyone to
experience mental health problems. Big changes in lifestyles
are
<span class="boldtext">
stressful for any person
</span>, especially from something
significant as a pandemic.
